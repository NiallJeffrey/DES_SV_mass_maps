Dark Energy Survey (Science Verification) weak lensing convergence map reconstructions from the paper: ArXiv 1801.08945.

The methods:
- Kaiser-Squires
- Wiener filter (Gaussian prior)
- GLIMPSE (Sparsity prior in wavelet space)

The included jupyter notebook opens the .npy files and performs a simple plot for comparison.
